**4.Wrapper class**
                Are those classes that wraps the primitive data types.   <br>
                Every primitive data types has its own class that extends object.   <br>
                 int num = 4   <br>
                 Interger n = new Integer(num);  //wrapping a int  <br>

                java is not 100% OOPL because it has primitive data types and why because, it is  faster and we use primitive data types mostly.
