**Interface**
                when we have to use all the methods that are abstract only then we can use interface. so by default all the methods inside interface are public and abstract and all the varaibles inside interface are final and static.     <br>
              ```java
                interface A{
                  //all abstract methods.
                }
              ```  

 **Types of interface**    <br>

    *Normal Interface*       <br>
                it can have more than one methods.       <br>

     *Functional Interface*           <br> 
                Its a interface that has only one method.   <br>
                @FuntionalInterface    <br>

      *Marker Interface*    <br>
                Dont have any methods i.e blank      <br>
