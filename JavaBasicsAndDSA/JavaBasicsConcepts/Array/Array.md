 **Array**
                If we have to store more than one data then we use array.  <br>
                int num = {1,2,3};   <br>
                int num[] = new int[5];   <br>
 **16.Drawbacks of array**
                1.it is fixed size once defined.  <br>
                2.Doesnt accept heterogeneous data types. It has to be of same data types.  <br>
